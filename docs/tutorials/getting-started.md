# Getting Started: Deploy MicroCeph via Charm

In this guide we will deploy a 3-node charm-microceph cluster in an LXD environment using Juju. This guide assumes setting up an LXD environment on a single host machine with simulated storage. This works great for learning and testing purposes; in a production environment you would typically utilize Juju to deploy to several physical machines and storage media. 

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following prerequisites:
- a Linux machine with at least 16G of memory and 32G of free disk space
- with snapd installed
- and virtualization-enabled

It was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 VM (any Ubuntu from 22.04 onwards should work fine). Note that this guide might run into issues on a container (such as docker) as containers typically are lacking virtualization capabilities.


## Step 1: Install and configure LXD

Install the LXD snap and auto-configure it -- this will give the host machine the ability to spawn VMs, including networking and storage:

```
$ sudo snap install lxd
$ sudo lxd init --auto
```

Note that depending on your system, LXD might come pre-installed.

## Step 2: Install and bootstrap Juju

This step will install Juju, and subsequently configure Juju to make use of the LXD provider that was setup in the previous step. 

```
$ sudo snap install juju 
juju (3/stable) 3.6.8 from Canonicalâœ“ installed

$ juju bootstrap localhost lxd-controller
Since Juju 3 is being run for the first time, it has downloaded the latest public cloud information.
Creating Juju controller "lxd-controller" on localhost/localhost
...
Now you can run
	juju add-model <model-name>
to create a new model to deploy workloads.
```

If successful, `juju bootstrap` will prompt you to create a model. Models are the logical grouping of connected applications in Juju. We will create a model `mymodel`:

```
$ juju add-model mymodel
Added 'mymodel' model on localhost/localhost with credential 'localhost' for user 'admin'
```

Configure the model to spawn VMs with 4G of memory and a disk of 8G:

```
$ juju set-model-constraints virt-type=virtual-machine mem=4G root-disk=8G
```


For further details also consult the [Juju documentation on LXD](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/cloud/list-of-supported-clouds/the-lxd-cloud-and-juju/#the-lxd-cloud-and-juju)


## Step 3: Deploy MicroCeph

With the Juju environment configured, the next step is to deploy MicroCeph. With the below will will deploy 3 clustered MicroCeph units:

```
$ juju deploy microceph --num-units 3
Deployed "microceph" from charm-hub charm "microceph", revision 155 in channel squid/stable on ubuntu@24.04/stable
```

Juju deploys the MicroCeph units in the background. This process might take a few minutes depending on network speed and available resources. Check progress by running the `juju status` command. Once the deployment is done, `juju status` will report 3 active units:

```
$ juju status
Model    Controller      Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
mymodel  lxd-controller  localhost/localhost  3.6.8    unsupported  11:15:26Z

App        Version  Status  Scale  Charm      Channel       Rev  Exposed  Message
microceph           active      3  microceph  squid/stable  155  no       

Unit          Workload  Agent  Machine  Public address  Ports  Message
microceph/0   active    idle   0        10.106.25.67           
microceph/1   active    idle   1        10.106.25.66           
microceph/2*  active    idle   2        10.106.25.144          

Machine  State    Address        Inst id        Base          AZ  Message
0        started  10.106.25.67   juju-9fe08a-0  ubuntu@24.04      Running
1        started  10.106.25.66   juju-9fe08a-1  ubuntu@24.04      Running
2        started  10.106.25.144  juju-9fe08a-2  ubuntu@24.04      Running
```

Installing the MicroCeph units also bootstrapped a Ceph cluster. Check the status by SSH'ing to one unit and running `ceph -s`. This should result in something like the below:

```
$ juju ssh microceph/0 "sudo ceph -s"
  cluster:
    id:     e131a957-bb56-489c-bb10-1782cd29e5f2
    health: HEALTH_WARN
            OSD count 0 < osd_pool_default_size 3
 
  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum juju-9fe08a-2,juju-9fe08a-0,juju-9fe08a-1 (age 77s)
    mgr: juju-9fe08a-2(active, since 118s), standbys: juju-9fe08a-0, juju-9fe08a-1
    osd: 0 osds: 0 up, 0 in
...
```

The above shows a running Ceph cluster, however it displays a warning. Ceph warns because it by default expects 3 disks (OSDs in Ceph parlance) for storage, and we have not yet configured any.

## Step 4: Adding Disks

For the purposes of this guide we will be setting up small simulated disks for ease of configuration. Note these small loop disks are only suitable for a demo setup like this; in a production environment physical disks would be utilized instead.

Run the below to add loop based storage of 2G size to a unit:

```
$ juju add-storage microceph/0 osd-standalone="loop,2G,1"
added storage osd-standalone/0 to microceph/0
```

This will configure the first unit with a 2G OSD. When running `juju status` you should see the unit status to `executing` and a status message appear that an OSD is being enrolled.

Continue by running the same command for the other two units:

```
juju add-storage microceph/1 osd-standalone="loop,2G,1"
juju add-storage microceph/2 osd-standalone="loop,2G,1"
```

It will take a few minutes to configure the storage for Ceph, but once done (the units will display a status of `active` / `idle`) the Ceph status should look something like this:

```
$ juju ssh microceph/0 "sudo ceph -s"
  cluster:
    id:     e131a957-bb56-489c-bb10-1782cd29e5f2
    health: HEALTH_OK
 
  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum juju-9fe08a-2,juju-9fe08a-0,juju-9fe08a-1 (age 7m)
    mgr: juju-9fe08a-2(active, since 8m), standbys: juju-9fe08a-0, juju-9fe08a-1
    osd: 3 osds: 3 up (since 34s), 3 in (since 42s)
```

## Conclusion

This concludes the Getting Started guide. We have successfully set up a Juju-managed MicroCeph cluster, ready to serve as a test and learning environment. Check out the [MicroCeph charmhub page](https://charmhub.io/microceph) to see how to integrate MicroCeph with other Juju applications.
